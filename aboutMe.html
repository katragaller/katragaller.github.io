	<p>My name is Kathryn Ragaller and I am from Minneapolis, MN. I grew up in Germany and then moved back to Minnesota. After high school, I attendend Marquette University in Wisconsin and have stayed here since. Right now I work in Marketing for a small internation company. I feel like I haven't been challenged enough and I want to explore the world of coding. I have always been fascinated by how and why websites are created. I love seeing a project from start to finish so I hope this experience at devCode will be awesome! I am exited to learn and grow as a coder!
